# Overview

# Interfacing with the TraitBlender Package Interactively

In Blender versions <= 3.x, Add-ons such as TraitBlender could be imported directly to the Blender console or a script via 

```{{python}}
import TraitBlender as tb
```

As of Blender 4.2, the Add-on system has changed. To import TraitBlender directly, use 

```{{python}}
import bl_ext.user_default.traitblender as tb
```
